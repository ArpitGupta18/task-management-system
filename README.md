# Task Management System

This is a Content (Task) Management System create using React.js. It consists of four pages, i.e., Dashboard, Tasks, Projects, and Settings.

## Pages:

Dashboard: contains the summary of all the task that are completed, in progress, and yet to do.

Tasks: contains a form that allows to add new tasks or edit existing task. Also allows to delete and search a task.

Projects: contains a form that allows to add new projects or edit existing project. Also allows to delete a project and view all the projects within a specific project.

Settings: contains a button that allows to toggle between light and dark theme. Although the functionality is present, it is not fully functional, and many changes can be made to improve the Dark theme.

Note: the site is responsive to different width size but many improvements can still be made.
